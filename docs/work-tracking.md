# Work Tracking - home-topology-ha

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-23

> Status note: this file contains historical sprint notes from December 2025.
> For current implementation status, treat `README.md` and code under
> `custom_components/home_topology/` as the source of truth.

## Current Snapshot (2026-02-23)

- Backend integration is largely complete and aligned to core v3 APIs.
- Event bridge now publishes `occupancy.signal` with `event_type` and `source_id`.
- Persistence, sync manager, service wrappers, and WS contracts are implemented.
- Backend test suites pass locally in the current environment (with `--no-cov`).
- Next focus is UI reliability and expanded frontend test coverage.

## 🎯 Current Sprint: UI Reliability + v3 Validation

**Sprint Goal**: Resolve panel UX issues and complete v3 live validation
**Dates**: 2026-02-23 onward
**Status**: 🟢 IN PROGRESS

## 📝 Decision Log

### 2025-12-10

#### Decision: Enhanced Mock Harness

- **Context**: Need faster frontend iteration without live HA
- **Decision**: Create full mock harness with state simulation, theme toggle, console logging
- **Rationale**: Matches guide recommendations, enables offline development
- **Impact**: High (10x faster UI iteration)

#### Decision: Granular Cursor Rules

- **Context**: Single .cursorrules insufficient for frontend context
- **Decision**: Create `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files for ha-components, patterns, styling
- **Rationale**: File-scoped AI context improves code generation accuracy
- **Impact**: Medium (better AI assistance)

### 2025-12-09

#### Decision: Documentation Structure

- **Context**: Need consistent docs that reference core library
- **Decision**: Create minimal docs that link to core library for kernel concepts
- **Rationale**: Avoid duplication, single source of truth for kernel
- **Impact**: Medium (better maintainability)
- **See**: ADR-HA-001 through ADR-HA-006
