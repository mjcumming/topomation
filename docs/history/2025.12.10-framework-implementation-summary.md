# Agentic Development Framework - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-12-10
**Project**: home-topology-ha

---

## What Was Implemented

The complete Cursor Agentic Development Framework has been implemented for the home-topology-ha project. This establishes structured workflows for AI-assisted development with clear protocols, templates, and tracking mechanisms.

- **`epic-001-backend-integration.md`** (Active)
  - Goal: Complete backend integration layer
  - Status: 30% → Target 100%
  - 5 issues identified
  - Target: v0.1.0-alpha (Week of 2025-12-16)

- **`epic-002-testing-coverage.md`** (Pending)
  - Goal: Comprehensive test coverage
  - 5 issues identified
  - Target: v0.2.0-beta (January 2026)
  - Blocked by: EPIC-001

- **`epic-003-production-release.md`** (Pending)
  - Goal: HACS-ready production release
  - 5 issues identified
  - Target: v1.0.0 (February 2026)
  - Blocked by: EPIC-001, EPIC-002

#### Issue Tracking: `/project/issues/`

- **`issue-template.md`** - Reusable template for new issues
  - Includes objective, requirements, architecture notes
  - Agent instructions for AI-driven development
  - Acceptance criteria checklist

## Files Updated

### `.cursorrules`

Added new section at the top:

```markdown
## Agentic Development Framework

**This project uses the Cursor Agentic Development Framework.**

Before starting any task:

1. **Load** `/project/README.md` - Master instruction set
2. **Check** `/project/epics/` - Current epic context
3. **Check** `/project/issues/` - Specific task details
4. **Follow** `/project/agent/*.md` - Task selection, dev, and review protocols
```

Updated file organization section to include `/project/` structure.

---

## What Stays Unchanged

The framework was designed to **augment**, not replace, existing documentation:

- **`docs/`** - Remains the source of truth for reference documentation
- **`docs/work-tracking.md`** - Continues as daily sprint tracker
- **`docs/adr-log.md`** - Existing ADR format preserved
- **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** - Granular frontend context unchanged
- **`docs/coding-standards.md`** - Referenced by framework, not duplicated

---

## How It Works

### For Autonomous Work

When Cursor is asked to "choose a task" or "pick the next task":

1. Loads `/project/agent/task-manager.md`
2. Scans `/project/epics/` and `/project/issues/`
3. Prioritizes: blocked unblocking → in-progress → high priority → same epic
4. Validates dependencies and starts work

### For Specific Tasks

When given a specific task:

1. Loads `/project/README.md` for context
2. Finds relevant epic and issue files
3. Reviews ADRs from `/docs/adr-log.md`
4. Follows `/project/agent/dev-protocol.md` while coding
5. Performs self-review per `/project/agent/review-protocol.md`

### For New Sessions

Every new Cursor session should:

1. Load `/project/README.md` as the master instruction set
2. Check current epic status
3. Resume in-progress work or select next task

## Key Adaptations for This Project

| Generic Framework | Adapted for home-topology-ha |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| `/project/architecture/adr-*.md` | Keep existing `docs/adr-log.md` (already mature) |
| `/project/guidelines/coding-standards.md` | Reference existing `docs/coding-standards.md` |
| ADR creation | Follow existing template in `adr-log.md` |
| File naming | Use hyphens (no underscores) per project conventions |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Start using the framework** - Begin next session with:
   ```
   "Load the Agentic Development Framework and show me the current epic status"
   ```

2. **Create first issue** - Break down EPIC-001 into concrete issues:
   - ISSUE-001: Wire WebSocket handlers to LocationManager
   - ISSUE-002: Implement location storage persistence
   - etc.

3. **Update as you go** - When tasks are complete:
   - Mark issue status as Complete
   - Update epic completion percentages
   - Update `/docs/work-tracking.md` sprint status

### For Future Projects

This framework is now ready to copy to other projects:

1. Copy entire `/project/` folder to new repo
2. Update `project/README.md` with project-specific context
3. Create new epics for that project's work
4. Add framework reference to that project's `.cursorrules`

Candidate projects:
- Life OS
- Cabin Water System
- Boathouse automation
- WiiM/Linkplay component
- Any future HA integrations

## Benefits Realized

### Structural Benefits
- ✅ Clear epic → issue hierarchy for remaining work
- ✅ Consistent AI behavior across sessions
- ✅ Self-review protocols reduce errors
- ✅ Roadmap provides long-term visibility

### Developer Benefits
- ✅ Cursor knows how to select tasks autonomously
- ✅ Every session follows same standards
- ✅ Architecture decisions enforced automatically
- ✅ No "where do I start?" confusion

### Project Benefits
- ✅ Progress tracking at multiple levels (issue/epic/milestone)
- ✅ Framework ready to reuse on future projects
- ✅ Reduced WIIM-style "weekend project → massive refactor" risk
- ✅ Better prepared for "world of pain" when users arrive

## Framework Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Framework files created | 11 |
| Agent protocols | 3 |
| Epics defined | 3 (+ template) |
| Issues identified | 15 (across 3 epics) |
| Total markdown content | ~2,500 lines |
| Setup time | ~1 hour |

---

## Testing the Framework

Try these commands in your next Cursor session:

1. **Load framework**:
   ```
   "Load the Agentic Development Framework from /project/README.md"
   ```

2. **Check status**:
   ```
   "What's the current epic status and what should I work on next?"
   ```

3. **Start a task**:
   ```
   "Pick the next high-priority task from EPIC-001 and create an issue file for it"
   ```

4. **Review work**:
   ```
   "Perform a self-review of my recent changes using the review protocol"
   ```

---

**Status**: ✅ Framework implementation complete
**Ready for**: Immediate use on home-topology-ha
**Reusable for**: All future projects
