# Workspace Rules

## Testing Philosophy

**NO BS MOCK TESTS - Write real tests**

- Write integration tests that actually test real functionality
- Avoid excessive mocking that makes tests meaningless
- Tests should verify actual behavior, not just that mocks were called
- Use real dependencies and real data flows whenever possible
- Mocks should only be used when absolutely necessary (e.g., external services, hardware)

## Naming Conventions

- No underscores in directory or file names
- Use hyphens for separation in file/folder names
- Use YYYY.MM.DD format for document file names
