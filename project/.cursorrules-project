# Project Folder AI Context

This `/project/` folder contains the **Agentic Development Framework** for this repository.

## What Cursor Should Know

When working in this repository, you MUST:

1. **Always load** `README.md` first (master instruction set)
2. **Check** relevant epic files before starting work
3. **Follow** agent protocols in `agent/*.md`
4. **Create** issue files for new tasks
5. **Update** issue status as work completes

## File Purposes

- **README.md** - Your governing instruction set (read this every session)
- **QUICK-START.md** - Daily workflow guide for users
- **FRAMEWORK-OVERVIEW.md** - Complete framework documentation
- **roadmap.md** - Multi-week timeline and milestones
- **agent/*.md** - How you should behave (task selection, coding, reviewing)
- **epics/*.md** - Feature-level work tracking
- **issues/*.md** - Task-level work tracking

## The Golden Rule

**Integration translates, kernel implements.**

This integration is a thin adapter. Never put behavior logic here—it belongs in the home-topology kernel.
